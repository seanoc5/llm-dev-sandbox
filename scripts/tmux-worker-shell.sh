# Invoked by the `bind-key -n C-z` worker escape hatch in ~/.tmux.conf.
# split-window calls this script; the script resolves the current session
# and window name via `tmux display-message -p` (which DOES expand #{...}
# formats — unlike split-window's literal shell-command argument), then
# execs into the matching swarm-<session>-<window> container.
#
# Container naming must stay in sync with provision-worker.sh.
#
# Errors print a friendly message and exit non-zero so the pane stays
# "[dead]" under remain-on-exit=failed, leaving the diagnosis visible.

# self-reference (tmux exports it into every pane's env), and -t accepts it.
